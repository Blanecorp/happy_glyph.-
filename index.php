	 <h1>Life is like a box of chocolates...actually no it isn't. Life is tough,
	 but it can also be really rewarding. Sometimes we get we want, other times
	 we don't, and then there are those really weird times which set you on a path you're 
	 not even sure how you got on to. Then right there, at the end of it. You'll see how you've
	 come, where are you now and maybe you'll get something better than you expected and like the view.
	 <br><br>
	 In essence, life is very unpredictable. However, lots of people have come before you either in your shoes or
	 in others, with plenty more people coming right after you also. Your story is important, and one of the bests
	 you can do is to help and guide others with your own experiences. Also having a solid group of friends and hard work is awesome too ;)

	 <h1>Work; Where we come to earn our wages, to pay for things we want and need. The Grind.
	 Okay, so it's not all that grim. Work can be fun, even the most uninteresting task can be
	 rewarding if you put the right spin on it. I mean Excel Spreadsheets, they're so....organised and nifty!!!
	 SEE LOOK GUYS, ENTHUSIASM!<br><br>Actually no, this misses the point. It's okay to not love your job, it's
	 okay if it's just to pay the bills whilst you pursue what you really want, and most importantly
	 it's okay if you havent found what it is your "passionate" about or don't have grand career goals. That not so
	 glamourous job could pay very well or your duties could be vital to a lot of people. We're not all gonna be superstars, but
	 I guarantee you even they don't find it all fun.

	 And if you're going to hell for what floats your boat, at least you can look forward to the fact that most of your friends and family will be there,
	 no one's perfect haha! We're living in a very grand time for anyone who is LGBTQ, the world is becoming more accepting with whoever you have in your
	 heart. <br><br>Whilst we still have some way to go; I'm looking at you religious nutheads who wont get with the times, things are slowly but surely improving.
	 But of course, if you want to still keep to yourself, then that's fine too. It's still a sensitive topic for some, but in keep in mind that there are people out there
	 that will accept you as you are. Perfect, in your own way.</h1>

   <center><h2 class="hiya"> HAPPY//GLYPH was setup in mind for when we have those bad moments in life and we need a little pick-me-up. 
   The cool thing is that we all can contribute to this with our own experiences and what we've 
   learnt from them. Got any useful advice for peeps who are down in the dumps? Head over to "Contribute" 
   where you can share the love. The best of the best get to have their advice shown to the world on the main page. Nothing fancy, just a site where we can all help out.</h2><br></center>
